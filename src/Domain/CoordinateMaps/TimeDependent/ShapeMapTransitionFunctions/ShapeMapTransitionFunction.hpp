/*!
 * \brief Abstract base class for the transition functions used by the
 * domain::CoordinateMaps::TimeDependent::Shape map.
 *
 * \details This base class defines the required methods of a transition
 * function used by the shape map. Different domains require the shape map to
 * fall off towards the boundary in different ways. This behavior is controlled
 * by the transition function. It is also needed to find the inverse of the
 * shape map. Since the shape map preserves angles, the problem of finding its
 * inverse reduces to the 1-dimensional problem of finding the original radius
 * from the mapped radius. The mapped radius \f$\tilde{r}\f$ is related to the
 * original \f$r\f$ radius by:
 * \f{equation}{\label{eq:shape_map_radius}
 *  \tilde{r} = r (1 - f(r,\theta,\phi) \sum_{lm} \lambda_{lm}(t)Y_{lm}(\theta,
 *  \phi)),
 *  \f}
 * where \f$f(r,\theta,\phi)\f$ is the transition function. Depending
 * on the format of the transition function, it should be possible to
 * analytically derive this map's inverse because it preserves angles and shifts
 * only the radius of each point. Otherwise the inverse has to be computed
 * numerically.
 *
 * The transition function must also be able to compute the gradient and the
 * value of the function divided by the radius. Care must be taken that this
 * does not divide by zero.
 *
 * All member functions with the exception of `original_radius_over_radius`
 * exist as overloads for types `double` and `DataVector` so that they work with
 * the templated shape map methods calling them. To avoid code duplication these
 * can be forwarded to templated implementation methods held by the derived
 * classes only.
 *
 * For an example, see SphereTransition.
 *
 * #### Design Decisions:
 *
 * It was decided to make the ShapeMapTransitionFunction an abstract base class
 * with overloads for types `double` and `DataVector` corresponding to the
 * template parameter `T` of the shape map's methods. The shape map holds a
 * `unique_ptr` to this abstract class using a common dynamic dispatch design
 * pattern. This approach avoids templating the shape map all together.
 *
 * An alternative approach would be to directly template the transition
 * functions onto the shape map so that no abstract base class is necessary.
 * These approaches can also be combined by making the transition function an
 * abstract base class but also templating it onto the shape map. In this way
 * the shape map does not need to hold a `unique_ptr` but can hold the
 * transition function directly as a member.
