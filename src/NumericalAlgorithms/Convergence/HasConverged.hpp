/*!
 * \brief Determine whether the `criteria` are met.
 *
 * \note This function assumes the `iteration_id` is that of the latest
 * completed step and that it is zero-indexed, where zero indicates the initial
 * state of the algorithm. Therefore, the `MaxIteration` criterion will match if
 * the `iteration_id` is equal or higher. For example, a `MaxIteration` of 0
 * means the algorithm should run no iterations, so it matches if the
 * `iteration_id` is 0 or higher since that's the initial state before any
 * steps have been performed. A `MaxIteration` of 1 matches if the
 * `iteration_id` is 1 or higher since one iteration is complete. At this point,
 * also the `residual_magnitude` reflects the state of the algorithm after
 * completion of the first iteration. The `initial_residual_magnitude` always
 * refers to the state before the first iteration has begun, i.e. where the
 * `iteration_id` is zero.
 *
 * \returns A `Convergence::Reason` if the criteria are met, or
 * `std::nullopt` otherwise. The possible convergence reasons are:
 *
 * - `Convergence::Reason::AbsoluteResidual` if the `residual_magnitude`
 *   meets the convergence criteria's `absolute_residual`.
 * - `Convergence::Reason::RelativeResidual` if `residual_magnitude /
 *   initial_residual_magnitude` meets the convergence criteria's
 *   `relative_residual`.
 * - `Convergence::Reason::MaxIterations` if the `iteration_id` is the
 *   convergence_criteria's `max_iterations` or higher. This is often
 *   interpreted as an error because the algorithm did not converge in the
 *   alloted number of iterations.
