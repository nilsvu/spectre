/*!
 * \brief The number of points that an overlap extends into the `volume_extent`
 *
 * In a dimension where an element has `volume_extent` points, the overlap
 * extent is the largest number under these constraints:
 *
 * - It is at most `max_overlap`.
 * - It is smaller than the `volume_extent`.
 *
 * This means the overlap extent is always smaller than the `volume_extent`. The
 * reason for this constraint is that we define the _width_ of the overlap as
 * the element-logical coordinate distance from the face of the element to the
 * first collocation point _outside_ the overlap extent. Therefore, even an
 * overlap region that covers the full element in width does not include the
 * collocation point on the opposite side of the element.
 *
 * Here's a few notes on the definition of the overlap extent and width:
 *
 * - A typical smooth weighting function goes to zero at the overlap width, so
 *   if the grid points located at the overlap width were included in the
 *   subdomain, their solutions would not contribute to the weighted sum of
 *   subdomain solutions.
 * - Defining the overlap width as the distance to the first point _outside_ the
 *   overlap extent makes it non-zero even for a single point of overlap into a
 *   Gauss-Lobatto grid (which has points located at the element face).
 * - Boundary contributions for many (but not all) discontinuous Galerkin
 *   schemes on Gauss-Lobatto grids are limited to the grid points on the
 *   element face, e.g. for a DG operator that is pre-multiplied by the mass
 *   matrix, or one where boundary contributions are lifted using the diagonal
 *   mass-matrix approximation. Not including the grid points facing away from
 *   the subdomain in the overlap allows to ignore that face altogether in the
 *   subdomain operator.
