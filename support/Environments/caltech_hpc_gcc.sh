    # Notes:
    # - Choosing the memory allocator to be JEMALLOC is important. When using
    #   the SYSTEM allocator, during BBH runs dumping volume data too often
    #   would result in memory corruption errors. Switching to JEMALLOC fixed
    #   these issues. It is still unclear *why* the SYSTEM allocator caused
    #   these issues. --Kyle Nelli
    # - We turn of docs because we aren't loading a Doxygen module. Could be
    #   added though.
    # - We override the architecture to skylake because that's the oldest type
    #   of nodes on CaltechHPC. All dependencies were also compiled for skylake.
    #   This means we should be able to run on all types of nodes available on
    #   the cluster.
    # - We temporarily turn off ParaView until a compatible version is
    #   installed.
