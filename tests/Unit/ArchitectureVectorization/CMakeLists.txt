# This executable builds only core components for testing Blaze vectorization
# on different architectures with different compilers.
#
# It can be used to test that vectorization with Blaze correctly works on all
# of our target architectures without needing access to the CPUs. This is
# made possible by the Intel Software Development Emulator.
#
# The relevant architectures as of 2020 and their Intel SDE flags are:
# SDE Flag  march Flag                                Architecture
# -nhm      -nehalem                                  Nehalem CPU
# -wsm      -westmere                                 Westmere CPU
# -snb      -sandybridge                              Sandy Bridge CPU
# -ivb      -ivybridge                                Ivy Bridge CPU
# -hsw      -haswell                                  Haswell CPU

# -clx      -cascadelake                              Cascade Lake CPU
# -cpx      -cooperlake                               Cooper Lake CPU
